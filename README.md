Java-Communication-Network


Author: M Sadiq Warsi

About
A Java-based communication network project demonstrating network communication concepts such as client-server socket programming. This project builds a foundational communication system where multiple clients can connect to a server to exchange messages or data over a TCP/IP network. It aims to showcase Java networking fundamentals suitable for learning, experimentation, and extending into more complex communication applications.

Features
TCP/IP socket-based client-server communication

Handling multiple client connections (if applicable)

 
Sending and receiving messages across the network

Demonstrates use of Java's java.net.Socket and java.net.ServerSocket classes

Basic error handling and connection management

Code designed for ease of understanding and modification

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or later recommended)

Basic understanding of Java programming and socket networking
